# jrn_emlassembyline

This repository contains script examples, metadata templates, and troubleshooting tests for using [EML_assemblyline](https://github.com/EDIorg/emlAssemblyLine) to package Jornada research data. This is all a work in progress - most useful for the Jornada LTER IM team as we develop new metadata generation methods.

## pkg210000000_example/

A data package directory set up to test EMLassemblyline scripts. It contains metadata templates in various formats, a dataset (mtcars), and a build script (possibly more to come). The directory is set up to illustrate a useful workflow and the build script is well commented to teach the user how EML files are build with EMLassemblyline.  

## \*_test/

Contain various test cases for EMLassemblyline or related packages - mostly for troubleshooting.
